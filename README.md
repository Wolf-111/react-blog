# react-blog

## MySQL Setup
- Since this project uses MySQL, you are going to need MySQL installed on your system
- Once that is complete, create a localhost database on your machine, and change the enviornment variables in `server/server.js` at the top of the file according to your database
- After you've created the database, create a table, `blogs`, with the columns of `title, author, content`
- Proceed to the general setup below

## General Setup
- `cd react-blog`, run `npm install`, then run `npm start`
- Open a seperate terminal, `cd server`, run `npm install`, then run `npm start`
